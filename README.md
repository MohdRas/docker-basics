BASICS
- What is Container & docker
  - base image layer - basic OS & dependencies
  - dependency layer - library + framework
  - code layer - code + configuration
  - build layer - tools & scripts to compile the application
  - run layer - runtime dependencies + configuration
  - To package our application with its dependencies & configuration.
  - Portable actifact between development & operation team.
  - To improve development/deployment of an application.
  - Development improvement - No need to follow different steps for each OS & Application.
  - Deployment imporovement - No need to share steps to deploy it with artifacts, dependencies, configuration

- Docker vs VM.
- Docker installation.
- Docker commands.
- Debug a container.
- Developing with containers.
- Docker compose
  - Running multiple services.
- Docker file
- Private Docker Repository ( AWS )
- Deploying containerized application.
- Volumes
  - Persisting data.
- Volumes Demo


CONTAINER

- To package our application with its dependencies & configuration.
- Portable actifact between development & operation team.
- To improve development/deployment of an application.

DEMO
 - Developing with container.
 - Docker compose - running multiple services.
 - Docker file - to build docker image
 - Private Docker Repository (AWS)  - push docker image
 - Deploy containerized application.
 - Volumes - Persist data in docker
